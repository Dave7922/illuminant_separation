The code provided here includes the demo.m script to show the lighting separation results on two and three lights case.

We also include the extern code base to determine the illumination coefficients for the three light case, and please cite the paper
when you use the code. 

We also provide the data used in the paper in the .mat files and you can also download the original raw images via
